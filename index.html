                Hello there! My name is Gustavo Martinez and I am excited to share a bit about myself with you. 
                I am a 28-years-old currently working at Amazon with a growing passion for understanding and exploring the world of technology. 
                I attended community college, majoring in Psychology, where I spent four fascinating years learning about human behaviors. 
                While completing my education, I embarked into the retail industry for seven years. 
                Over these years, I developed interpersonal and customer service skills while gaining valuable insights into consumer's behavior and building meaningful connections with customers. 
                Driven by a desire to broaden my professional horizons, I recently decided to enrolled in a six-month coding bootcamp. 
                This decision helped acquire programming and knowledge, enriching my problem-solve skills, and creativity. 
                Thank you for taking the time to get to know me better.
            </p>
